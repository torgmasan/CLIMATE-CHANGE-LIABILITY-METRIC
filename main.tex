\section*{Problem Description and Research Question}

Change has been exponentially quick in the last century, and it certainly has not been kind to the climate of our world. Instead of guiding us away from the brink of destruction, many of our leaders have steered us right to the tipping point; it is very difficult for us now to return to the wildlife-rich and climate-healthy world that we had before. Our problem is that some very privileged people are allowed to take decisions that adversely affect the entire planet.
\\ We have decided to research how various factors contribute to the individual impact of a nation on the worsening climate of the earth. We want to quantitatively find out how a country is responsible for climate change and discuss the need for immediate action by countries (especially those which are influencing climate change in a significantly larger proportion).
